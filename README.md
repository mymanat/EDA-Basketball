# EDA-Basketball

## Overview
**EDA-Basketball** is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project that examines basketball data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in the game and machine learning-based MVP prediction. 
The project leverages Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data visualization and analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze basketball statistics and performance metrics.
- Identify key trends and patterns in player/team performance.
